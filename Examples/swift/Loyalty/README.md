### Loyalty app

This app uses a few external dependencies managed through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).

You can check if you have CocoaPods installed by running:
```
$ pod --version
```

If you don't have CocoaPods installed you must install them before building this app. You can follow [CocoaPods getting started instructions](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

In the project folder run:
```
$ pod update
```
to add pods to your project.

Make sure you open the project using .xcworkspace file instead of .xcodeproj file.
